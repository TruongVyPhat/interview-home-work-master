 I implemented Restful API to send data from server-side to client which was built using NodeJS and ExpressJS.

 The database is using for this  project is PostgreSQL online from AWS RDS (you can see it in server/config/config.json) so it takes longer to load data.

 I used react-bootstrap + react sematic UI to build client.

 I am keen on back-end more so I haven't learned Redux before even though I have known it.
 I tried to using Redux in this project yesterday.However it took me longer time to understand Redux.

 Sorry for it. :)
